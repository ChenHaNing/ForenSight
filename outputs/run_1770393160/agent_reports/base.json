    "截至2025年3月28日，非关联方持有股票市值约为3.25万亿美元。"
  ],
  "reasoning_summary": "基于提供的证据，识别出三个主要风险点。第一，报告明确提及对先前财务报表错误的更正，这属于历史内控缺陷的直接证据，需要关注其性质、影响及是否已彻底解决。第二，流动比率（0.89）和速动比率（0.86）均低于1.0的通用安全阈值，现金比率（0.22）也较低，表明短期偿债能力存在压力，这与公司庞大的市值和强劲的盈利能力形成反差。第三，公司展现出极高的盈利能力（毛利率46.9%，净利率26.9%），但营运效率指标（总资产周转率1.16）和流动性指标相对较弱，这种特征组合需要进一步分析其商业模式和现金管理策略是否可持续。整体风险被评估为中等，因为虽然存在明确的警示信号，但公司市值巨大且盈利能力强，单一指标异常可能不足以构成重大舞弊的直接证据，需要更多信息进行交叉验证。",
  "suggestions": [
    "核查财务报表更正的具体内容、原因、涉及的会计期间、金额及对当期和前期报表的影响，评估其是否涉及收入确认、成本计量等关键领域。",
    "分析流动性指标偏低的具体原因，结合现金流量表（如提供的10-Q中显示经营现金流强劲）和债务结构，判断是暂时性现象还是结构性特征。",
    "结合业务分部、地域分布和收入结构（当前信息缺失）等背景信息，深入分析高利润率与相对较低周转率、流动性之间的协同关系，评估是否存在为维持利润率而牺牲营运资金效率或进行不当会计处理的风险。",
    "审查内控审计报告章节，确认与财务报表更正相关的内控缺陷是否已被识别并得到有效补救。"
