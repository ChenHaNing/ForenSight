48 我们在世界各地提供并参与 电子废弃物循环利用计划，同 时继续探索能够更便捷地为 用户回收产品的途径。 因而， 我们通过加入 CEF 会员，与 Google、Amazon、 Dell Technologies 和 Microsoft 合作，试行了一个 上门回收利用项目。通过这一 试点项目，自 2022 年 2 月 起，丹佛市的用户可以直接在 家中订购电子废弃物回收取 件服务。 产品生命周期的每个阶段都意义重大，其中包括生 命周期结束阶段。即使某个产品或零件不能再发挥 预期功能，它们仍可能是下一代产品有价值的材料 来源。 高效循环利用这些材料，使得循环供应链能让有限的资源物尽其用。这 就要求我们与多方展开通力合作，包括折抵自己旧产品的用户，以及回 收其中材料的回收机构。通过这种方法，我们正在降低对开采新材料的 需求，减少制造新产品所需的能源量，最终降低排放、节省资源。 通过合作和创新，优化回收方式 回收利用是我们打造循环供应链的重中之重。我们想方设法让用户更容 易回收利用我们的产品。在 99% 的销售 Apple 产品的国家或地区中， 我们会继续开展并参与产品回收和循环利用计划。在我们的零售店，顾 客可以折抵自己不再使用的设备或将其交由我们回收处理，同时当地 运营机构也提供了各种回收利用计划。此外，顾客还可通过诸如 Apple Trade In 换购计划等在线平台，获取更多的回收利用方案。得益于顾客 和员工对这些回收利用项目的积极参与，2021 财年我们将全球总计逾 38000 吨的电子废弃物转为循环利用。 我们对回收商伙伴有着高标准。我们找到了一些在业界表现出色、拥 有高回收率并能遵循我们严格标准的回收机构，并与他们展开合作。在 2021 财年，我们就劳动权益与人权、安全性和 EHS 法规等问题，在全 球范围内开展了 75 次回收机构合规性审查。我们还与回收机构紧密合 作，进一步推进优秀范例在其场所设施内的应用。我们所有位于北美洲 的回收机构都获得了 e-Stewards 或 R2 等电子行业的领先认证。 我们致力于确保回收机构拥有足够的实力和资源，能够高效地回收每件 Apple 产品。这需要合作、培训和持续的支持。我们的专家甚至会与回 报废产品处置 收商伙伴的员工一起在回收点现场作业，以更好地了解他们的需求和所 面临的挑战。去年，我们推出了新的《Apple 回收机构指南》，为专业的 电子产品回收机构提供指导，帮助其了解如何安全地拆解 Apple 产品， 以及如何最大限度地回收资源。该指南由我们的工程团队开发，旨在提 高回收率，确保各类专业回收机构能够利用我们提供的工具和流程，按 部就班地完成回收。该指南提供了关于设备拆解各个步骤的实用信息， 并推荐了可处理已拆解零部件的下游材料回收机构。此外，我们也一直 在寻求创新，以期为回收机构提供强有力的支持。今年，我们将试行一款 简单易用的增强现实工具，为合作伙伴提供关于设备拆解和回收的更优 质培训。我们还在着手开发机器视觉系统，以更好地分类和整理废料，优 化材料回收。 在世界各地回收商伙伴的支持下，2021 财年我们得以将全球总计逾 38000 吨的电子废弃物转为循环利用。 概述 气候变化 资源 更高明的化学工艺 参与及合作 附录 2022 年环境进展报告

作为元宇宙第一流量入口，潜力值得关注。2021 年成“元宇宙元年”，大事件频出，市场关注度大幅提升。海外，“Facebook 更名为Meta”、“微软收购暴雪”体现巨头深耕元宇宙硬件及内容的决心；国 内，“字节跳动收购Pico”有望开启国产VR 一体机终端大规模推广的序幕。 VR/AR 作为元宇宙时代信息的入口和载体，有机会成为下一代互联网的智能终 端，抢先布局硬件具备战略意义。 硬件突破驱动应用需求产生，VR/AR 硬件将是元宇宙率先起势的领域。复盘智 能手机的发展历程，其前期主要由硬件技术进步推动，设备性能提升和功能增 加，才能给内容和应用的创新带来更多可能。2007 年iPhone 1 多点触控屏幕 帮助摆脱物理键限制，重新定义智能手机，移动游戏、视频等新兴应用开始逐 步盛行。我们认为，只有VR/AR 硬件出现并成熟，实现二维屏幕到三维空间的 跃进，才能在此基础上开发游戏、社交、办公等多元应用和生态，开启元宇宙 序幕。 图1：复盘智能手机发展，硬件是变革早期驱动力，并预判VR/AR 发展阶段和发展路径 资料来源：电子发烧友，IT 之家，电科技，新浪财经，腾讯研究院，亿欧，手机出货数据来自IDC 预测，VR 出货数据来自光大证券研究所预测，AR 出货数据由VR 陀螺预测 敬请参阅最后一页特别声明 -9- 证券研究报告 VR/AR 行业

年，光波导、显示等零部件成熟，Meta 和苹果 预期发布AR，有望进行产品定义和C 端渗透； 2032-2037 年，有望出现AR 一体机，取代手机 - 目前局限 软件生态未完全建立，缺少需求 零部件（如光波导）不成熟，硬件初级尚未产品定义 - 资料来源：人民网，全景智慧城市，光大证券研究所整理 虚拟现实（Virtual Reality，VR）与增强现实（Augmented Reality，AR）均 有望成为元宇宙入口，但存在诸多差异。 1） 应用：VR 强调虚拟沉浸，与现实世界隔绝，适用于大段休闲时间的泛娱乐 和泛社交场景，如游戏、视频、直播、展览、教育培训等；AR 强调虚实融 合和可移动性，可帮助解放双手，用于与现实相关的大多数场景，如工业 生产、医疗、信息提示等； 2） 市场潜力：VR 因沉浸、交互特性定位为媒介载体，有望对游戏机、投影仪、 电视等娱乐电子设备进行取代，进而渗透至健身、医疗、教育等场景进行 辅助，我们预期长期出货量有望达4000 万台到数亿台；AR 因连接现实应 用更广泛，最终一体机形式有望取代手机成为新一代生产力工具，因此更 具市场发展潜力； 3） 硬件：两者诸多技术互通，但AR 光学系统更复杂，且轻量化要求与性能矛 盾更大，尚待零部件迭代，目前苹果、Meta 等海外巨头皆尚未完成产品定 义，仍处于硬件发展早期阶段；VR 发展基本成熟，目前聚焦硬件性能升级 和软件生态建立。 我们认为，VR 和AR 在当下各具发展机遇：VR 进入硬件性能爬升阶段；更具 潜力的AR 有望2025 年完成C 端的产品定义，开启C 端渗透序幕。 1） VR：中短期（2022-2025 年）为VR 硬件性能爬升期，VR 头显将增加多样 化功能并增强性能以提升用户体验，2025 年有望达到硬件成熟期。 2020 年，Meta Quest 2 完成产品定义和C 端渗透。此后，VR 硬件聚焦功 能增多和性能升级，驱动上游零部件和技术模块迭代、采用新技术路径； 敬请参阅最后一页特别声明 -10- 证券研究报告 VR/AR 行业 2022 年，受新品推迟发布和Meta 上调价格等短期因素影响，出货增长暂 缓； 我们预计，2023 年，随着Meta、苹果、索尼等众多重磅VR 头显的发布， 市场有望再次活跃，推动全行业技术升级和出货量持续提升； 2025 年，随着Micro LED 显示技术、更高性能XR 芯片和重要感知交互功 能等的成熟，VR 设备走向成熟，硬件性能迭代基本完成； 2025 年后，VR 发展重心转移至内容端，进入应用生态发展期，更多内容 和场景的出现提升市场需求，出现下一增长拐点。 图2：2018-2026 年VR 全球出货量及预测 资料来源：IDC，VR 陀螺，光大证券研究所预测 根据上述各年的VR 驱动因素，预测VR 在中短期3-4 年的出货量数据。VR 出货量整体增长趋势受硬件性能迭代、内容生态改善等因素推动，各年出 货预测则参考待出新品数量、新品突破水平以及具体发售时间等因素。一 方面预测增长率，参考2020 年Meta Quest 2 头显带动VR 行业，给予多 产品待出的2023 年和2025 年较高增速；另一方面统计各VR 头显品牌当 前销量和布局，分别预测各品牌未来出货水平。两个维度进行交叉验证和 数据调整，得到2022 年-2026 年中短期阶段相对合理的VR 出货量预测。 VR：长期（2026 年后）有望对游戏机、电视机等当下的电子设备形成替代 效应，出货量潜力空间或在上亿级。现阶段VR 应用场景主要集中于游戏， 也出现少量视频、直播应用。未来，VR 应用有望向社交、办公等领域拓展

昨天，特斯拉在第四季度财报电话会上确认，将在今年第二季度正式停止 Model S 和 Model X 的生产，并把弗里蒙特工厂的产线全面转向 Optimus 人形机器人及相关 AI 业务。. 供应链人士称，新机在体验与权限体系上将比初代测试版更成熟。与此同时，豆包团队已与部分互联网服务提供商（打车、外卖、订票等）达成常用权限接入协议，以提升系统级 AI Agent 的可用性。. 本月中旬，阿里官宣对千问 APP 进行重大升级，将其与电商平台、在线旅游服务以及蚂蚁集团的支付系统深度整合，力求打造一个能够协助用户完成订餐、预订旅行等实际任务的全能 AI 助手。. 此外，报道还提到，阿里和字节都在进行更长远的布局，正在开发能够无缝处理文本、图像、音频、视频和代码的全能型 AI 模型。. OpenAI 宣布将于 2026 年 2 月 13 日在 ChatGPT 中正式下线多款旧模型，包括 GPT‑4o、GPT‑4.1、GPT‑4.1 mini 以及 OpenAI o4‑mini，同时此前已公布的 GPT‑5 Instant 与 GPT‑5 Thinking 也将在同日退役。. 昨天，Meta 在财报沟通中全面强化了其 AI 战略，CEO 马克 · 扎克伯格多次强调 2026 年将成为「AI 深刻改变工作方式」的一年。. 昨天，字节跳动 CEO 梁汝波在全员会上分享了公司 2026 年度关键词「勇攀高峰」，并围绕 AI 时代的行业趋势、公司战略重点、人才机制与组织文化进行了系统阐述。. 梁汝波表示，过去 50 年 IT 行业的主要技术高峰（PC、Web、Mobile）大约以 15 至 20 年为周期出现，而 AI 的重要性至少与 PC + Web 同级。. 据新浪科技报道，蚂蚁集团 CEO 韩歆毅近日向全体员工发布内部信，总结过去一年在 AI 应用、支付创新与全球化布局上的进展，并披露多项关键业务数据。. 据 The Verge 报道，Google 正在为 Chrome 推出由 Gemini 驱动的全新「自动浏览」（auto browse）功能，可在浏览器内执行多步骤任务，并率先向美国地区的 Google AI Pro 与 Ultra 订阅用户开放。.

核心结论：苹果凭借“硬件+服务+生态”的三重壁垒，构建了兼具盈利稳定性与长期增长性的商业模式。2026财年第一季度财报表现超预期，营收、净利润均创历史新高，iPhone业务强势复苏叠加服务业务高毛利支撑，短期受益于换机周期与新兴市场增长；中长期依托Apple Intelligence落地、Vision Pro渗透及AI技术迭代，持续巩固行业龙头地位。我们给予公司“买入”评级，核心催化因素为iPhone新品周期、服务业务扩容及AI功能落地，需重点关注供应链约束与市场竞争风险。. 苹果公司（Apple Inc.，NASDAQ：AAPL）成立于1976年，总部位于美国加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺，2007年完成业务转型并更名，目前是全球领先的消费电子与软件服务提供商。公司核心业务涵盖硬件产品研发销售与配套软件服务，全球员工约15万名，业务遍及全球主要经济体，活跃设备安装基数已突破25亿台，形成了覆盖个人消费、企业服务的全场景生态体系。. 公司业务按产品类别划分为五大核心板块，形成“硬件为基础、服务为增量”的协同格局，各板块定位清晰、互补性强：. ：旗舰核心业务，贡献主要营收与利润，涵盖高端智能手机全系列，最新iPhone      17系列市场反响热烈，是全球换机需求的核心驱动力；. * 服务（Services）：高毛利增长引擎，包括App Store抽成、Apple Music/TV+订阅、iCloud云服务、Apple Pay手续费等，细分领域持续创新扩容；. ：个人计算机产品线，涵盖笔记本与台式机，依托自研Apple      Silicon芯片构建性能优势，企业市场渗透率持续提升；. * 可穿戴、家居与配件：包括Apple Watch、AirPods、HomePod等产品，安装基数持续创新高，受供应链限制短期增速承压，但长期增长潜力显著。. 苹果在全球消费电子行业占据绝对龙头地位，尤其在高端市场形成垄断优势：全球智能手机出货量稳居前列，2025年有望首次超越三星登顶全球冠军，高端市场（单价＞600美元）市占率遥遥领先，占据逾80%的行业利润；iPad与Mac在各自领域市占率分别达37%与全球前列，客户满意度均维持在96%以上；服务业务营收持续创下新高，付费订阅用户实现两位数增长，生态粘性不断强化。. 结合苹果2026财年第一季度（截至2025年12月底）财报及2025财年全年数据，各业务板块表现分化但整体向好，核心增长动力明确，业务结构持续优化。. **2.1 核心硬件业务：iPhone引领增长，板块分化明显**. **2.1.1 iPhone业务：史上最佳季度表现，成增长核心引擎**. 2026财年第一季度，iPhone业务营收达853亿美元，同比大幅增长23%，占总营收比重高达59.3%，创下历史最佳季度表现，成为公司营收增长的核心驱动力。核心增长逻辑包括：iPhone 17系列受市场热捧，在全球多地区创营收纪录；中国市场升级换机与新用户转化均达双位数增长，大中华区营收同比飙升38%，贡献显著；新兴市场（尤其是中国和印度）需求强劲，进一步拓宽用户基数。长期来看，全球3.58亿台二手iPhone用户的升级需求，叠加新品迭代周期，将持续支撑iPhone业务增长。. **2.1.2 其他硬件业务：iPad逆势增长，Mac与可穿戴设备短期承压**. iPad业务表现亮眼，2026财年第一季度营收86亿美元，同比增长6%，安装基数与升级用户数创新高，本季度购买iPad的消费者中半数为首次购入，显示出新用户群体的强劲需求，美国市场客户满意度达98%。Mac业务营收84亿美元，同比下降7%，主要因搭载M4芯片的新款MacBook Pro上市周期较短，未能充分贡献营收，但新兴市场仍实现正增长，企业市场如Snowflake、阿斯利康等均在扩大Mac设备部署规模。可穿戴、家居及配件业务营收115亿美元，同比下降2%，主要受AirPods Pro 3供应限制影响，若排除供应约束，该板块有望实现正增长，目前Apple Watch安装基数创下历史新高，首次购买用户占比超半数，美国市场客户满意度达96%。. * 营收：总营收达1437.56亿美元，同比增长16%，远超市场预期的1384亿美元，核心驱动力为iPhone业务的强势增长与服务业务的持续扩容；. * 利润：净利润420.97亿美元，同比增长15.9%；摊薄后每股收益2.84美元，同比增长18.3%，高于市场预估的2.68美元，毛利率维持高位，核心得益于服务业务高毛利的拉动；. * 其他：预计其他收支约1亿美元（不含少数股权投资按市值计价影响），税率约17.5%。. 苹果的核心竞争力在于构建了“硬件+服务+生态”的三重护城河，形成了竞争对手难以复制的竞争优势，支撑公司长期稳定增长，具体体现在四个方面：. 目前全球内存市场供需不平衡加剧，先进制程芯片（3纳米）产能不足，成为影响公司未来硬件业务供应与成本的核心约束，尤其可能影响iPhone、AirPods Pro 3等核心产品的出货量，进而影响短期营收增长。同时，内存价格持续上涨，将对第二季度及后续毛利率产生一定压力，尽管公司已考虑相关因素并制定应对方案，但供应链风险的不确定性仍需警惕。. * 服务业务扩容：广告业务持续拓展（如App Store新增广告位）、Apple TV+布局优质内容（如F1版权），有望推动服务业务营收维持双位数增长，进一步提升毛利率；. * 供应链缓解：若先进制程芯片供应约束缓解，AirPods Pro 3、Mac等产品出货量提升，带动相关业务复苏；. | 核心财务指标 | 营收（亿美元） | 1437.56（+16% YoY） | 4161.61 |. | 净利润（亿美元） | 420.97（+15.9% YoY） | 1120.10 |. | 每股收益（美元） | 2.84（+18.3% YoY） | 7.49 |. |
